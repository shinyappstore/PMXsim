# PMXsim: Simulate and Explore Pharmacokinetic Profiles

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/PMXsim](https://shinyappstore.com/a/PMXsim)__

PMXsim is a versatile application designed to facilitate the simulation of pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and explore diverse dosing regimens. With PMXsim, users can easily upload datasets that include key columns for DOSE and concentration, essential for matching colors with the simulated profiles. Pharmacokinetics encompasses the study of how the body processes drugs, focusing on their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME). In the realm of PK, numerous parameters play pivotal roles in defining a drug's profile. These include the drug's clearance rate, volume of distribution, half-life, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and peak concentration (Cmax). Understanding and manipulating these parameters is essential for optimizing drug dosing regimens and predicting their effectiveness in clinical scenarios. PMXsim empowers users to explore these vital PK parameters and their impact on drug profiles, contributing to improved therapeutic decision-making.
